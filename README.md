Cat-Tag
=======

Using JMonkey and Blender, we're creating a game called cat tag. Play tag as cats.

The game will be an Assassin's Creed type game in the sense that the camera will be behind and above the cat that you play as a player.

The game will feature walking, running, jumping, tackling, climbing, and beind able to hide in various environments.

Environments will include indoors, outdoors (all the seasons), and populated areas.

The game will be multiplayer.

Decisions that need to be made
=

* Which scenes should be implemented
* How should a cat stop, should there be a delay? How should a cat turn?
